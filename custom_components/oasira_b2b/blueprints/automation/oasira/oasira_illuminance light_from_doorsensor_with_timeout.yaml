  name: Door Activated Light with Illuminance and Timeout
  description:
    Automatically actitvate a light with a door sensor attached to the
    door, activating a smart switch or light.  The light will turn off at the end
    of a timer.  Logic is also implemented to turn off the light in the event it's
    manually turned on while the door is open or after the automation has already run. Use label "SleepArea" on any lights you do not want to turn on while sleeping.
